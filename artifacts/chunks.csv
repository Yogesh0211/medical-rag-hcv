Generally, routine HCV testing is cost-effective because the incidence and prevalence of HCV remain high in people who inject drugs with a notable rising prevalence in young adults who may not readily report their stigmatized risk behaviors. Studies conducted in urban emergency departments in the US, for example, reveal that 15% to 25% of patients with previously unidentified HCV infection were born after 1965 and/or have no reported history of injection drug use and are, therefore, missed by even perfect implementation of risk-based screening (Schechter-Perkins, 2018); (Hsieh, 2016); (Lyons, 2016)."

In contrast, NS5B nucleotide RASs are rarely detected (1% of failures) even after exposure to a failing DAA regimen containing a nucleotide inhibitor (Wyles, 2018b); (Svarovskaia, 2014). This is likely due to the highly conserved catalytic site region that nucleotides bind, making substitutions in this region extremely rare—often referred to as a high barrier to resistance—they are not rare because they do not occur but rather because any such substitution at this site would likely render the virus replication incompetent."

Sofosbuvir-Based Regimens In November 2019, the US FDA amended the package inserts for sofosbuvir-containing regimens to allow use in patients with renal disease, including those with an eGFR ≤30 mL/min and those on dialysis. A retrospective evaluation of clinical trial participants in 76 clinical trials treated with sofosbuvir with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-89 mL/min/1.73 m2  in nationally-representative administrative claims database demonstrated that participants with CKD did not experience worsening eGFR during sofosbuvir-based treatment, and sofosbuvir was not associated with an increased risk of ESRD in patients with CKD (Sulkowski, 2022)."

Introduction Background In 2015 it was estimated that there were approximately 71 million individuals chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide,1,2 many of whom were unaware of their infection.3 HCV infection remains one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide.1,4 The long-term natural his- tory of HCV infection is highly variable: the hepatic injury can range from minimal necro-inﬂammatory changes to extensive ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."

easl_hcv_guidelines_2020_cleaned.txt,9,"enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, and because of developments in diagnostic procedures and radical improvements in therapy and pre- vention. The primary goal of HCV therapy is to cure the infection, i.e. to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) deﬁned as undetectable HCV RNA after treatment completion. An SVR corresponds to a cure of the HCV infection, as late relapse occurs in less than 0.2% of cases beyond 6 months of follow- up.5 An SVR is generally associated with normalisation of liver enzymes and improvement or regression of liver necroin- ﬂammation and ﬁbrosis, and improvement in liver function.6–8 The risk of HCC and liver-related mortality is signiﬁcantly reduced, but not eliminated, in patients with cirrhosis who clear HCV compared to untreated patients and non-sustained virological responders, especially in the presence of cofactors of liver morbidity, such as the metabolic syndrome, harmful alcohol consumption and/or concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.6,9–17 HCV is also associated with a number of extra- hepatic manifestations, but viral elimination can reduce all- cause mortality.18–25 This ﬁnal update of the EASL Recommendations on Treat- ment of Hepatitis C series started in 2014 is intended to assist physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as patients and other interested individuals, in the clinical decision- making process, by describing the current optimal manage- ment of patients with acute and chronic HCV infections."
